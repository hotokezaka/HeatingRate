decay_chain_thermal_beta.ipynb, decay_chain_thermal_alpha.ipynb, decay_chain_theraml_fission.ipynb work with Jupiter Notebook. These codes calculate nuclear heating rates of beta-decay, alpha-decay, and spontaneous fission of r-process nuclei. Each heating rate is compted for a given abundance pattern, ejecta mass, velocity, and density profile.

These codes support both Python 2 and Python 3.
