decay_chain_thermal_beta.ipynb, decay_chain_thermal_alpha.ipynb, decay_chain_theraml_fission.ipynb work with Jupiter Notebook. These codes calculate nuclear heating rates [erg/s/g]  of beta-decay, alpha-decay, and spontaneous fission of r-process nuclei, taking into account for thermalization of gamma-rays and charged decay products in r-process ejecta. Each heating rate is computed for a given abundance pattern, ejecta mass, velocity, and density profile.

These codes support both Python 2 and Python 3.
